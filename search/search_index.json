For a predictive posterior $\\nu$ its uncertainty can be formulated as $$ F(\\nu) = \\sup_{\\mu \\in \\bar{B}_{\\varepsilon}(\\nu)} \\mathbb{E}^{\\mu} [f], $$ where $\\bar{B}_{\\varepsilon}(\\nu)$ is a Wasserstein ball centered at $\\nu$ with radius $\\varepsilon$. For each candidate $\\nu$ we take the radius of its Wasserstein ball as the distance to the closest ground truth $\\left( \\mathcal{M} - set of all ground truths \\right)$. $$ \\varepsilon = \\inf_{\\mu \\in \\mathcal{M}} \\mathbb{W}_2(\\nu, \\mu). $$ Under minor assumptions the supremum is achieved at the boundary. This result is used to reformulate regret for a predictive posterior given by a generative surrogate as $G(\\theta)$ as follows: $$ \\mathcal{R} {\\mathbb{W}}(\\theta) = \\mu(\\theta) - \\kappa \\cdot \\inf _2(G(\\theta), \\mu). $$}} \\mathbb{W","title":"Description"},{"location":"wu/#usage","text":"from waggon.acquisitions import WU [2] Tigran Ramazyan, Mikhail Hushchyn and Denis Derkach. \"Global Optimisation of Black-Box Functions with Generative Models in the Wasserstein Space.\" Arxiv abs/2407.1117 (2024).
